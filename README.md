# NAVI

A prototype that brings AI-powered accessibility to Google Sheets for blind and visually impaired (BVI) users. NAVI reads the sheet, summarizes it aloud, answers questions by voice or text, and can edit cells on command.

## Setup

Requires Node 22+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io).

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 2. Create a local development secrets file
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Build the extension
pnpm build
```

Then load it in Chrome: `chrome://extensions` → enable **Developer mode** → **Load unpacked** → select the `.output/chrome-mv3` folder.

The `.env` setup is for local development only. Do not put a shared OpenAI API
key in a public build: WXT/Vite embeds environment values in the generated
JavaScript, where users can inspect them.

Reading and editing sheets both use your Google sign-in (OAuth), so **private spreadsheets work** — no "anyone with the link" sharing needed, and no Google Sheets API key.

### One-time OAuth setup (needed for reading and cell edits)

The extension ID is pinned to `fojpekkjeokfmckeohalgnmdjcdeejme` (via the `key` field in the manifest), so it is the same on every machine. In **Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials → the NAVI OAuth client (Chrome extension)**, set the **Item ID** to that value once. Reading and chat work without this; cell edits need it to authenticate.

## Where NAVI works

Google **Sheets**, **Docs**, and **Slides** — the same "Hey NAVI" everywhere. She remembers her recent answers across tabs in the session: ask for a number in Sheets, open your Doc, and say *"add a paragraph with that revenue figure"*.

## Using NAVI (voice-first)

Open a sheet and **just say "Hey NAVI"** — she answers with a short overview of the workbook and starts listening. Speak your question; she stops recording when you go quiet. The wake word is on by default (menu switch to disable); NAVI pre-reads the workbook silently in the background so her first answer is instant. The typing box is hidden by default — a menu switch brings it back (e.g. for braille keyboards).

## Speech controls

| Action | Keyboard (Mac: Alt = Option ⌥) | Button |
|---|---|---|
| Open NAVI (works on Windows/Mac/Linux, even while the sheet has focus; remap at `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`) | **Alt + N** | click the eye icon |
| Pause / resume (resumes at the current sentence) | tap **Shift** once | ⏯️ |
| Replay the last message (when nothing is playing) | tap **Shift** once | ⏯️ |
| Stop completely | tap **Shift** twice quickly | ⏹️ |
| Speak faster / slower (5 steps, remembered) | **Alt + .** / **Alt + ,** | — |
| Open the NAVI menu (text size, output mode, greeting, speed) | **Alt + M** | — |
| Quit NAVI (asks for confirmation, press again to confirm) | **Alt + Q** | ✕ |
| Screen-reader mode + announce the active cell | **Ctrl + Alt + Z** | via menu |
| Read what's on the clipboard | **Alt + C** | — |
| "Hey NAVI" wake word (opt-in, via menu; listens while the panel is closed) | say **"Hey NAVI"** | — |

A clean Shift tap only — Shift held with any other key (normal typing) never triggers playback controls.

Opening NAVI greets you and immediately scans + summarizes the sheet — there is no setup screen. Text size is changed from the menu and remembered.

First launch plays a short spoken tour of the controls (skippable with a double Shift tap, replayable from the menu).

The menu (Alt+M) also switches the **voice** (fast system voice vs natural OpenAI voice), the **typing box**, and the **language** (English / Bahasa Indonesia). The microphone engine is auto-picked (Whisper with echo cancellation when available).

**Using a screen reader (NVDA / JAWS / VoiceOver)?** Switch NAVI to screen-reader mode (menu → "Read out loud: My screen reader", or Ctrl+Alt+Z). NAVI then stays silent and your screen reader reads its responses — no two voices talking over each other. The manual screen-reader test script lives in [docs/a11y-testing.md](docs/a11y-testing.md).

## Development

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pnpm dev` | Dev mode with hot reload (opens a Chrome window with the extension loaded) |
| `pnpm test` | Run the unit tests (Vitest) |
| `pnpm test:watch` | Tests in watch mode |
| `pnpm compile` | TypeScript typecheck |
| `pnpm build` | Production build into `.output/chrome-mv3` |

Tests live next to the code as `*.test.ts` and run in CI on every push and pull request.

## Public releases

Every merge to `main` builds, tests, checks, and packages a Chrome Web Store
ZIP. Web Store submission remains disabled until the first listing is complete
and NAVI has a production AI connection that does not expose a shared API key.

See the [Chrome Web Store release guide](docs/chrome-web-store-release.md) for
the simple setup checklist, listing copy, and continuous-deployment settings.
NAVI's data practices are documented in the [privacy policy](PRIVACY.md).

## Project structure

```
src/
  entrypoints/       WXT entrypoints — content script (UI shell) + background worker (OAuth writes)
  core/              Platform-independent logic: LLM client, speech (TTS/voice input), command parsing
  platform/sheets/   Google Sheets specifics: reading values, editing cells, URL/tab detection
  ui/                The floating icon + chat panel
public/icons/        Extension icons
```

The `core/` vs `platform/` split is deliberate: core logic stays reusable for the planned Microsoft Excel add-in.
